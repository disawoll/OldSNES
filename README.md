# OldSNES: SNES VC for Old 3DS users

WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL:
- Updated to snes9x_3ds v1.30 by moosan82.
- Updated to use Qyriad's banner creating procedure.
- Removed support for blargSNES.


PRE-INSTRUCTIONS (INSTALLING SNES9X):
- Download snes9x_3ds from: https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/releases
- Follow the instructions on: https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds/blob/master/readme.md


INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create a folder for each game on the input folder (Earthbound, for example).
- Put your SNES rom on this folder.
- Put an icon image on this folder and rename it icon.png or icon.jpg. This can be whatever image you want for the home menu icon (a screenshot, for example).
- Run make_snes9x.bat.
- Type in the game's title, description (optional), publisher, product code (SNS-MW-USA, for example), and unique id (whatever you want from 00000 to fffff).
- Install the generated CIA file. (it's in OldSNES/cia/ folder)
- Enjoy.

Note: If you don't provide an icon image, banner.png/banner.jpg will be used for the icon instead.


CUSTOM BANNER (OPTIONAL):
- Download "Ultimate SNES Forwarder Maker for 3DS" from https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-ultimate-snes-forwarder-maker-for-3ds.460895/
- Run "Ultimate SNES Forwarder Maker for 3DS.exe"
- Open your rom file (.sfc or .smc)
- Enter Long name, Short name & Game publisher then click "Load icon image" and choose an image. (This can be whatever image you want for the home menu icon)
- Click on "Export icon.bin" button on the bottom then set the export location to OldSNES/input/"GameName" and name set the name as "icon".
- Click on "Next step (3d banner)" to advance to next part.
- Click on "Load inner image" and choose an image (a box art or cartridge label image of the game) then choose a style. 
- Enter banner text (1) and (2) accordingly to your game. Font used is not the same as the original vc titles so we're going to adjust that. Go to "OldSNES/input/" you'll see "SCE-PS3-RD-R-LATIN.TTF" click on it to install the font. Then go back to the app and click on "Select font (1) & (2)" and change font used to what you installed just now.
- Once you're all done, click on "Export banner.bin" button on the bottom then set the export location to OldSNES/input/"GameName" and name set the name as "banner".
- You can close the program now, we just used this program to create the banners for our vc.


UPDATING EXISTING CIAS:
- Put all of yours cias inside the cia folder (keep a backup of them just in case something goes wrong).
- Run update_snes9x.bat.
- OPTIONAL: If you want to add or replace files, put them into the folder you created for the game, then confirm when prompted to "include or update any extra files".
- OPTIONAL: If you want to delete existing files, go to the romfs folder and delete whichever file(s) you want. DO NOT DELETE ROM.SMC.

TRANSFERRING PRE-EXISTING SAVE FILES:
- Run the Virtual Console version first, then replace its savefile with your current one. The VC savefile is located on at the "snes" folder on the root of the SD card. (The same applies to savestates and the config. file)
